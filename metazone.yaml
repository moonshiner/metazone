# Inline zone templating- these zones are always locally mastered by the name servers.
# In metazone, they are expressed by block quotes and should always be sent via the
# b64: method.
#
# Supported variables:
# $name - zone name
# $nsg  - name server group name
# $time - UTC time in ISO format
#

edge_zones:
    rpz.example.com:
        !include rpz.template.yaml

#
# The pattern "delay:eval:nsg!='east'" tells metazone: If you are a
# nameserver in the "east" name server group (NSG), you are not fowarding
# queries (forward evaluates to False), instead, you are a secondary for
# the zone (with masters inherited from the NSG or default)- the
# local-forward-list is ignored. If you are a nameserver NOT in the
# "east" NSG, then forward queries to the server set mentioned by the
# local-bridge attribute, which is late binding due to the "fetch" method.
#
# local-forward-list is not encoded by a APL record, so is more suited for conditional
# evaluation, and overrides forward-list if it exists.
